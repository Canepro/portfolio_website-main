## 📝 Notes

### Design Decisions
- Keeping styled-components for now (no Tailwind migration planned)
- Hash routing for sections on homepage, page routing for other pages
- Project data in constants.js until we have 20+ projects

### Technology Choices
- Next.js 14 with Pages Router (not App Router yet)
- npm as package manager (not yarn)
- Netlify for hosting (not Vercel)
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

### Future Considerations
- Migrate to App Router when stable
- Consider Contentful/Sanity for content management
- Evaluate need for state management (Redux/Zustand)
- Explore edge functions for API routes
